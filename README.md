# Linux-System-Mini-Resource-Monitor

This is project to better understand how Linux as whole stores data in /proc directory.

Here we have learned and utilised this directory to extract raw data from it and parse it into a human readable format. 

This only targets specific parts of /proc directory instead of the whole directory.
